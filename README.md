# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to my Etch-a-Sketch project! This project is a fun implementation of the classic drawing toy, allowing users to create drawings by hovering over a grid of squares.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a challenge from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal was to create an interactive drawing application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid**: Users can create a new grid of varying sizes (up to 100x100).
- **Random Colors**: Each square changes to a random color upon hover.
- **Opacity Effect**: The squares progressively darken with each interaction, allowing you to achieve a fully colored square in just ten hovers.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
